# Molly's Vending Machine : Your Raspberry Pi's Side Hustle as a Pet Butler 🍽️🐾

Welcome to `Molly's Vending Machine`, Molly is my dog, this dapper daemon that turns your Raspberry Pi into a pet's best dinner companion—second only to you when you accidentally drop that piece of chicken. 😜

Now, hold your horses (or rather, your furballs)—`Molly's Vending Machine` doesn't come with tiny robot hands to scoop kibble. You'll need to don your DIY hat 🎩 to build the actual munchie-dispensing contraption. What `Molly's Vending Machine` does is lend you its digital smarts to make your feeder the Einstein of the pet food world.

### What's on the Menu?

With `Molly's Vending Machine`, you'll get:

- A snazzy web interface to set feeding times with more precision than a cat stalking a laser pointer.
  
- A RESTful API that's so easy to use, even your pet could probably code up something. (Okay, not really, but it's super user-friendly!)

- An auto-discovery protocol to spot feeders on your network, perfect for when they're playing hide and seek.

- A notification system that supports email, MQTT, and Twitter because even your pet's meals deserve live tweets.

`Molly's Vending Machine` struts around in NodeJS with Vue.js as its fashion-forward front-end.

### A Little Whisper on Security 🕵️

Keep it on the DL, but `Molly's Vending Machine` is like that laid-back friend who doesn't lock their doors. It's cool for a pet feeder, but maybe not for the Internet jungle. No passwords or secret handshakes here—keep it cozy behind your firewall, like a hamster in a blanket.

If the thought gives you the heebie-jeebies, slap on an nginx proxy for that HTTP authentication swagger, or just wave goodbye to the web interface once your digital pet butler is all set up.

### Will It Work on My Pi?

`Molly's Vending Machine` plays nice with:

- Raspberry Pi Zero (though it's a bit like a sloth, so maybe not for the speed demons)
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2
- Raspberry Pi 3 and its flashy sibling, the 3B v1.2
- Raspberry Pi 3B+ (the plus is for extra pizzazz)
- Raspberry Pi 4 (strongly recommended, because why settle for less?)

The Pi Zero is cute and all, but it's got the memory of a goldfish—best to opt for its bigger siblings.

So strap on your coding gloves, and let's make feeding Fido a futuristic frolic! 🚀
